🏦 Bank Churn Prediction
A Machine Learning project to predict customer churn for a bank, using a variety of classification models. This project is part of a placement assessment, focusing on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and business insights.

📊 Project Overview
Customer attrition (churn) is a major concern in the banking industry. This project builds a predictive model that classifies whether a customer is likely to churn or not. By identifying the key drivers of churn, banks can take proactive steps to retain customers.

Train/Test Split and Cross-Validation

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

🧠 Problem Statement
Predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the bank) based on various attributes such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, number of products, etc.

📝 Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data patterns.

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling

Class balancing

Model Building

Used multiple classification algorithms wrapped in pipelines

Baseline model with Logistic Regression

Tuned models using GridSearchCV or similar techniques

Model Evaluation

Compared models based on precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC

Selected the best-performing model for deployment

Feature Importance

Analyzed which features are most predictive of churn

Business Insight & Impact

Suggested actionable insights to help the bank reduce churn

📈 Key Results
Achieved high accuracy and ROC-AUC score using ensemble models (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting).

Identified key churn factors: Credit Score, Age, Number of Products, and IsActiveMember.

💡 Business Impact
By implementing the churn prediction model:

The bank can proactively retain high-risk customers through personalized offers.

Marketing efforts can be optimized based on churn likelihood.

Cost of acquiring new customers can be reduced through improved retention.

✅ Future Improvements
Try advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM.

Implement SHAP for better interpretability.

Build a Streamlit app for user-friendly prediction.
